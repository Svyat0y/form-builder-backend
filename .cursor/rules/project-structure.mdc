# Project Structure Rules

## Core Principles

When developing, follow the project structure according to NestJS best practices and the technologies used.

### Module Structure

Each functional module should follow this structure:

```
module-name/
  ├── module-name.module.ts      # NestJS module
  ├── module-name.controller.ts  # Controller (if API endpoints exist)
  ├── module-name.service.ts     # Business logic
  ├── module-name.entity.ts      # TypeORM entity (if exists)
  ├── dto/                       # DTOs for this module (if module-specific)
  ├── decorators/                # Custom decorators (if exist)
  └── guards/                    # Guards (if exist)
```

### Common Components Location

- **DTOs**: Shared DTOs are placed in `src/dto/`, module-specific DTOs - inside the module
- **Entities**: Placed inside the corresponding module
- **Common components**: Filters, pipes, guards, interceptors - in `src/common/`
- **Config**: Configuration files - in `src/config/`
- **Types**: Global types and extensions - in `src/types/`

### Code Organization Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each functional block should be a separate module
2. **Separation of concerns**: Controller → Service → Repository/Entity
3. **DRY**: Avoid code duplication, extract common logic into services or common components
4. **Naming**: Use consistent file and class names according to NestJS conventions

## Code Comments

- **Comments should only be added when necessary** - code should be self-explanatory through good naming and structure
- **All comments must be written in English** - this applies to both inline comments and documentation comments
- Avoid obvious comments that simply restate what the code does
- Use comments to explain "why" rather than "what" when the reason is not immediately clear
- JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions are encouraged
